#Using machine learning to predict autism
#for this project I will be using:
#Python Libraries:
	Numpy (numpy) for numerical operations.
	Pandas (pandas) for data manipulation.
	Matplotlib (matplotlib) and Seaborn (seaborn) for visualization.
#Machine Learning Libraries:
	Scikit-learn (sklearn) for splitting data, encoding, scaling, metrics, SVM, and logistic regression.
	XGBoost (xgboost) for using the XGBoost classifier.
	Imbalanced-learn (imblearn) for handling imbalanced datasets.

#Ensure you have them installed on your device/enviornment
